  "description": "The post office is a bustling, well-organized space filled with wooden cubbies, sealed scroll tubes, and small pigeonholes for parcels. A polished oak counter stretches across the back wall where a meticulous clerk sorts letters with remarkable speed. A large board displays names of adventurers with awaiting mail, and a secure drop chute hums faintly with magical energy to send messages across the realms. The scent of wax, parchment, and a hint of pipe smoke hangs in the air. Occasional chatter and the flutter of courier birds echo through the high rafters, giving the room an energetic, utilitarian charm. This is where news, letters, and payments are exchanged, bridging far-off lives with handwritten words.",
