  "description": "This sacred chamber radiates a calm and radiant warmth, its marble floor inlaid with golden sigils and concentric circles of divine scripture. At the far end stands a raised dais upon which the cleric guildmaster delivers sermons and oversees training. Incense smoke curls upward toward a high vaulted ceiling, where stained glass panels filter soft multicolored light into divine patterns across the room. Padded prayer mats and ritual implements are neatly arranged, and the air carries a subtle hum of divine energy. This is where initiates are tested, healed, and guided into deeper mysteries of their calling.",
