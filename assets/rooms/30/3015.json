The room echoes faintly with the sounds of past battles—boots thudding on training mats, steel clashing against wooden dummies. Weapon racks line the walls, though most are currently empty, their contents taken by members off to train or fight. Banners in red and black hang from the vaulted ceiling, each stitched with the crest of the guild: crossed blades beneath a roaring lion. A reinforced oak door to the north leads back to the avenue.",
