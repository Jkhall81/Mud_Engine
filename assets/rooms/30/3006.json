  "description": "You stand in the heart of Midgaard's bustling Market Square, though at this early hour it's serene and nearly empty. A grand fountain stands at the center, its clear waters bubbling peacefully and catching the morning light in shimmering arcs. The square is paved in worn flagstones that have borne generations of travelers, merchants, and townsfolk. Wooden benches line the edges beneath iron streetlamps, and flowering planters add vibrant life to the stonework. From here, well-worn paths lead in all directions to the cityâ€™s major districts. The space feels open and alive, a place where commerce, conversation, and the rhythm of city life converge.",
