Weathered stone benches curve around a central oak tree whose thick branches offer shade throughout the day. Children sometimes play here while elders share tales beneath the tree's sheltering limbs. Simple stalls are occasionally set up for local events or announcements. A path of smooth flagstones leads north toward the heart of the city.",
