  "description": "The scent of oiled leather and polished steel hangs heavy in the air of Durik's Armor Emporium. Weapons are notably absent, as every wall and rack is dedicated solely to armorâ€”gleaming breastplates, studded leathers, and chainmail sets line the room with practiced precision. A thick wool rug muffles footsteps, and a stout dwarven proprietor eyes the room from behind a heavy counter. Lanternlight glints off polished pauldrons and helms displayed on mannequins around the shop. A wooden door leads back out to the avenue to the south.",
