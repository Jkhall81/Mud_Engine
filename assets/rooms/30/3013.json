  "description": "This stretch of Sagewind Avenue narrows slightly as the buildings loom closer, their upper stories nearly touching across the street. The cobblestones are worn smooth by generations of boots and hooves. To the south, a wide archway bears a weathered emblem of crossed blades—the entrance to the Warrior’s Guild. The avenue continues east and west, framed by banners fluttering above shopfronts and training halls alike.",
