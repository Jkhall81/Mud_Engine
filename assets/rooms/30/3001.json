  "description": "You stand in the grand Temple of Midgaard, a vast chamber bathed in the gentle glow of enchanted sconces affixed to towering marble columns. The air is thick with the scent of incense, a mix of sandalwood and myrrh that lingers long after it's burned. Red velvet carpets stretch across the polished stone floor, muffling your footsteps and guiding pilgrims toward a distant altar. Murals depicting ancient gods and forgotten battles cover the arched ceiling, their colors still vibrant despite the ages. A sense of peace and solemnity pervades the space, sheltering all who enter within its hallowed walls. Near the entrance stands a sturdy wooden donation box, carved with celestial runes, inviting offerings from the faithful.",
