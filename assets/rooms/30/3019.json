  "description": "The soft hush of rustling ivy and distant birdsong gives this narrow stone lane a quiet charm. Flanked by old ivy-covered buildings and delicate wrought-iron balconies, Silverglen Walk feels more like a secluded garden path than a city street. Small flowerbeds sit beneath every window, and the stonework underfoot is smooth and pale. To the west, the path opens into the bustling Market Square.",
