  "description": "You're standing at the eastern end of Sagewind Avenue, a cobbled thoroughfare that carries the scent of fresh bread and aged parchment. Though many merchant stalls here remain shuttered in the early light, signs of life stir behind ornate wooden façades. Ivy crawls up the walls of stone storefronts, and hanging lanterns sway gently in the breeze. The avenue stretches west, narrowing slightly between buildings that whisper stories of trade, history, and quiet ambition.",
