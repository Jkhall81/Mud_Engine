Slots in the ceiling reveal the raised portcullis above, and racks of spare crossbows and quarrels line the walls. A pair of benches sit near a brazier where guards warm themselves between patrols. A narrow staircase spirals upward into the wall tower, though it's barred to civilians. The only exit is south, back to Sagewind Avenue.",
